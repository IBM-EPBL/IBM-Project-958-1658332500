# WEB PHISHING DETECTION ![ezgif-1-3e517db3ac](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72733514/198100745-cc606746-bd8c-4431-aa40-379429319d00.gif)

    Web service is one of the key communications software services for the Internet. 
    Web phishing is one of many security threats to web services on the Internet. 
 A number of users who purchase products online and make payments through e-banking, though certain issues get arised such as: 
  * The e-banking websites that ask users to provide sensitive data such as username, password & credit card details, etc., often for malicious reasons. 
  * This type of e-banking website is known as a phishing website.

* Web phishing aims to steal private information, such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details, by way of impersonating a legitimate entity.

* It will lead to information disclosure and property damage.          

* Large organizations may get trapped in different kinds of scams.

## <img src="https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-cc181a583e.gif"> EFFECTIVE SOLUTION
       
* To detect and predict e-banking phishing websites, we proposed an intelligent, flexible and effective system that is
      based on using classification algorithms. 
* We implemented classification algorithms and techniques to extract the phishing datasets criteria to classify their
      legitimacy. 
* The e-banking phishing website can be detected based on some important characteristics like URL and domain identity, and 
        security and encryption criteria in the final phishing detection rate. 
* Once a user makes a transaction online when he makes payment through an e-banking website our system will use a data mining 
        algorithm to detect whether the e-banking website is a phishing website or not.

# PROJECT OBJECTIVES <img src="https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-5fade44b80.webp">

* To understand the problem to classify between regression or a classification kind of problem.
* To know how to pre-process/clean the data using different data pre-processing techniques.
* Applying different algorithms according to the dataset
* To know how to find the accuracy of the model.
* To build web applications using the Flask framework.

# PROJECT FLOW <img src="https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-cf10ed65a9.gif">

* Download the dataset.
* Preprocess or clean the data.
* Analyze the pre-processed data.
* Train the machine with preprocessed data using an appropriate machine learning algorithm.
* Save the model and its dependencies.
* Build a Web application using a flask that integrates with the model built.

 ## <img src="https://im2.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-2-a7ca7e33d9.gif">Step 1: ANACONDA NAVIGATOR

* Anaconda Navigator is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for data science and machine learning related applications. 
* It can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS. Conda is an open-source, cross-platform,  package management system.
* Anaconda comes with great tools like JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, QtConsole, Spyder, Glueviz, Orange, Rstudio, Visual Studio Code.

Note:
 
    1.Open anaconda prompt.
    2.Type “pip install numpy” and click enter.
    3.Type “pip install pandas” and click enter.
    4.Type “pip install matplotlib” and click enter.
    5.Type “pip install scikit-learn” and click enter.
    6.Type “pip install Flask” and click enter.
    
    For this project, we will be using Jupyter notebook and Spyder.

* Sklearn: 

       Scikit-learn is a library in Python that provides many unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms.

* NumPy: 

       NumPy is a Python package that stands for 'Numerical Python'. It is the core library for scientific computing, 
       which contains a powerful  n-dimensional array object  

* Pandas:
     
       pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool,
       built on top of the Python programming language. 

* Matplotlib: 
     
       It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits

* Flask:
     
       Web framework used for building Web applications.
